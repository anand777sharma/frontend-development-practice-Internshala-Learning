-------------------index.html--------------------
in this project i first worked ont the basic structur using bootstrap framework 
i first create a div with a container class so that it can leave some spacing from the left and right side.
i used h1 tag for the heading with text-center class to place the title in the center.
i created a div with with row class and a mt-4
inside this row i created three columns-> first for the first number ,second for the operater and third for the second number.
with first number input i used oninput to use clearanswer() function
with opereter select tag i used onchange to use clearanswer() function
with Second number input i used oninput to use clearanswer() function
then on submit button i connect the calculate() function.
after this i have the answer textfield whis is disabled and with class disabled
after that i have a div with id error to show the error.

------------------script.js----------------
i first have the clear answer function but i have made this functin at the last only
i use this function to clear the value of answer and error on the change of any number.
then i have create returning functin for the mathematical calculations.
after this i have created the calculate() function 
in this function the operation is chooed based on the operater selected by the user.
after that we will check that the out put is number or no using isNAN function.
if the number is number then the number isdisplayed as output else the error is displayed
without any value.
