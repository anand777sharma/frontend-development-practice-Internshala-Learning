        Lucknow is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state
        of Uttar Pradesh and it is also the second largest urban agglomeration in Uttar Pradesh.Lucknow is the
        administrative headquarters of the eponymous district and division. Having a population of 2.8 million as per
        2011 census, it is the eleventh most populous city and the twelfth-most populous urban agglomeration of India.
        Lucknow has always been a multicultural city that flourished as a North Indian cultural and artistic hub, and
        the seat of power of Nawabs in the 18th and 19th centuries.It continues to be an important centre of
        governance, administration, education, commerce, aerospace, finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, design,
        culture, tourism, music, and poetry.

        Lucknow stands at an elevation of approximately 123 metres (404 ft) above sea level. The city had an area of 402
        km2 (155 square miles) until December 2019, when 88 villages were added to the municipal limits and the area
        increased to 631 km2 (244 square miles). Bounded on the east by Barabanki, on the west by Unnao, on the
        south by Raebareli and in the north by Sitapur and Hardoi, Lucknow sits on the northwestern shore of the Gomti
        River. As of 2008, there were 110 wards in the city. Morphologically, three clear demarcations exist: The
        Central business district, which is a fully built up area, comprises Hazratganj, Aminabad and Chowk. A middle
        zone surrounds the inner zone with concrete houses while the outer zone consists of slums.

        From 1350 onwards, Lucknow and parts of the Awadh region were ruled by the Delhi Sultanate, Sharqi Sultanate,
        Mughal Empire, Nawabs of Awadh, the British East India Company and the British Raj.
</p><p>
        For about eighty-four years (from 1394 to 1478), Awadh was part of the Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur. Emperor
        Humayun made it a part of the Mughal Empire around 1555. Emperor Jahangir (1569–1627) granted an estate in Awadh
        to a favoured nobleman, Sheikh Abdul Rahim, who later built Machchi Bhawan on this estate. It later became the
        seat of power from where his descendants, the Sheikhzadas, controlled the region.

        The Nawabs of Lucknow, in reality, the Nawabs of Awadh, acquired the name after the reign of the third Nawab
        when Lucknow became their capital. The city became North India's cultural capital, and its nawabs, best
        remembered for their refined and extravagant lifestyles, were patrons of the arts. Under their dominion, music
        and dance flourished, and construction of numerous monuments took place.[25] Of the monuments standing today,
        the Bara Imambara, the Chota Imambara, and the Rumi Darwaza are notable examples. One of the Nawab's enduring
        legacies is the region's syncretic Hindu–Muslim culture that has come to be known as the Ganga-Jamuni
        Tehzeeb.

        Chota Imambara is a Shia Muslim Hussainiya and a mausoleum for Muhammad Ali Shah.
        Until 1719, the subah of Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire administered by a governor appointed by the
        emperor. Persian adventurer Saadat Khan, also known as Burhan-ul-Mulk, was appointed Nizam of Awadh in 1722 and
        established his court in Faizabad, near Lucknow.
    </p><p>
        Many independent kingdoms, such as Awadh, were established as the Mughal Empire disintegrated. The third Nawab,
        Shuja-ud-Daula (r. 1753–1775), fell out with the British after aiding the fugitive Nawab of Bengal, Mir Qasim.
        Roundly defeated at the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, he was forced to pay heavy penalties and
        surrender parts of his territory.[28] Awadh's capital, Lucknow rose to prominence when Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth
        Nawab, shifted his court to the city from Faizabad in 1775. The British East India Company appointed a
        resident (ambassador) in 1773 and by early 19th century gained control of more territory and authority in the
        state. They were, however, disinclined to capture Awadh outright and come face to face with the Maratha Empire
        and the remnants of the Mughal Empire. In 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and the
        British and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan take the throne.[30] He became a
        puppet king, and in a treaty of 1801, yielded large part of Awadh to the East India Company while also agreeing
        to disband his own troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-controlled army. This treaty effectively made
        the state of Awadh a vassal of the East India Company, although it continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in
        name until 1819. The treaty of 1801 proved a beneficial arrangement for the East India Company as they gained
        access to Awadh's vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the
        revenues from running Awadh's armed forces brought them useful returns while the territory acted as a buffer
        state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the
        British had grown impatient with the arrangement and demanded direct control over Awadh.

        Bada Imambada is famous for its maze called 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa' in Hindi-Urdu. It is built of identical
        75-centimetre-wide (2.5 ft) passageways like the one shown in this photograph.
        In 1856, the East India Company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state for alleged
        maladministration. Awadh was placed under a chief commissioner Sir Henry Lawrence. Wajid Ali Shah, the then
        Nawab, was imprisoned, then exiled by the East India Company to Calcutta.In the subsequent Indian Rebellion
        of 1857, his 14-year-old son Birjis Qadra, whose mother was Begum Hazrat Mahal, was crowned ruler. Following the
        rebellion's defeat, Begum Hazrat Mahal and other rebel leaders sought asylum in Nepal.

        Lucknow was one of the major centres of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and actively participated in India's
        independence movement, emerging as a strategically important North Indian city. During the Rebellion (also known
        as the First War of Indian Independence and the Indian Mutiny), the majority of the East India Company's troops
        were recruited from both the people and nobility of Awadh. The rebels seized control of the state, and it took
        the British 18 months to reconquer the region. During that period, the garrison based at the Residency in
        Lucknow was besieged by rebel forces during the Siege of Lucknow. The siege was relieved first by forces under
        the command of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram, followed by a stronger force under Sir Colin Campbell.
        Today, the ruins of the Residency and the Shaheed Smarak offer an insight into Lucknow's role in the events of
        1857.

        With the rebellion over, Oudh returned to British governance under a chief commissioner. In 1877, the offices of
        lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh were combined; then in 1902,
        the title of chief commissioner was dropped with the formation of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh,
        although Oudh still retained some marks of its former independence.

        The Khilafat Movement had an active base of support in Lucknow, creating united opposition to British rule. In
        1901, after remaining the capital of Oudh since 1775, Lucknow, with a population of 264,049, was merged into the
        newly formed United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. In 1920, the provincial seat of government moved from
        Allahabad to Lucknow. Upon Indian independence in 1947, the United Provinces were reorganised into the state of
        Uttar Pradesh, and Lucknow remained its capital.

        Lucknow witnessed some of the pivotal moments in the history of India. One is the first meeting of the stalwarts
        Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohd Ali Jinnah during the Indian National Congress session of 1916 (the
        Lucknow pact was signed and moderates and extremists came together through the efforts of Annie Besant during
        this session only). The Congress President for that session, Ambica Charan Majumdar in his address said that "If
        the Congress was buried at Surat, it is reborn in Lucknow in the garden of Wajid Ali Shah."

        The Kakori conspiracy involving Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Rajendra Nath Lahiri, Roshan Singh and
        others, followed by the Kakori trial which captured the imagination of the country, also took place in
        Lucknow.
    </p><p>
        Culturally, Lucknow has also had a tradition of courtesans, with popular culture distilling it in the avatar
        of the fictional Umrao Jaan.
